                <p class="fs-7">It is important that <a href="https://www.theclimatecoalition.org/act-now-change-forever">you have already registered to participate in the lobby</a>, otherwise you will not be able to meet with your MP.

                <p class="fs-7">A major debate and vote on the Universal Credit and PIP Bill is taking place on 9th July, and some MPs may be called away at short notice.

We’re well prepared for this — and if your meeting time or location changes, we’ll let you know straight away.</p>
